A delight for those who love junk food, these food streets are the building bites of the city’s diverse food culture.
        
        For those who are new to this term, the term khaugalli literally means ‘food street’.Khau Gallis are popular not just for their wide variety of dishes, but also because most of these snacks can be consumed on the go and are light on the pocket.
        
        Right next to the Ghatkopar Station is the Ghatkopar Khau Galli, which is extremely famous for its variety of dosas. The street food’s vendors take innovation and fusion a notch higher; the Ice-cream Dosa and the Thousand Island Dosa are truly creative and fancy. But if you want to go with a safer bet, try their JiniDosa and Sai SwadDosa, or go for the evergreen favorite, pav bhaji.
        
        Famous for its Punjabi and Sindhi dishes, Chembur’s Khau Galli has the best of kulchas, dal pakwans, ragda pattice and dal tadka. Also look out for the sweet shops; their sev barfis, milk cakes and gulab jamuns are extremely popular with foodies. At some of these shops, you’ll also find great varieties of dosas as well as Gujarati snacks; they are absolutely delectable!`,

Large crowds of people come to this place to stride along the beautiful walkway and to view the stunning sight of the setting sun at dusk. Marine Drive is also referred to as 'Queen's necklace', because the street lights make the road look like a string of pearls and create an illusion of a necklace, when viewed at night from any elevated point along the pathway of the drive. 
        
        Towards the northern end of Marine Drive lies one of the oldest seafronts called Chowpatty Beach, which is famous for its bazaars and meals. Hundreds of salesmen walk across the beach to sell different varieties of items especially on Sunday evenings. Stalls featuring fast food and snacks such as Bhel Puri, Paav Bhaji, etc are set up in the area every single day.
        
        Marine Drive is considered as the best pathway for an evening stride. The sight of sparkling waters of the Arabian Sea and the amazing feeling of cold breeze caressing your hair along with a long array of restaurants offering mouthwatering snacks and drinks can make any low day bright again.`,

Iconic at best, ask any Mumbaikar and they will tell you that the Causeway is pretty much the heart of Mumbai. Apart from gorgeous clothes and accessories, especially earrings, you can also find great bargains on home decor stuff such as lampshades, curios and antiques. If designer stuff is your calling, there are a number of options for that as well. If you do feel like catching a bite and a beer, there are a number of restaurants that offer great food and booze at very affordable prices!

        Colaba Causeway acts as the land link between Colaba and the Old Woman's Island. It lies close to the Fort area which is a business sector and the heart of the city since the British era. From roadside vendors to glamorous boutiques, the street sells everything you can think of buying – in different quality and prices. Catch the old world movies charm at Regal Cinema. Behind Regal Cinema, the Causeway leads you to the Gateway of India overlooking the Arabian Sea. Here, the majestic Taj Mahal Palace Hotel dominates the city's skyline. Colaba Causeway is the heart of Mumbai and it's the liveliest you will ever see the city!
        
        Do not give in to first-time prices with the hawkers. Dig in deeper because the roadside stalls have a brilliant and diverse stock, but do not forget to bargain. Half of the originally quoted price will typically be the selling price. Also, carry cash because the temporary shops will not accept any plastic money.`,

The caves are located on the Elephanta or Gharapuri island which is situated at a distance of 11 km from the city of Mumbai. Natively known as Gharapurichi Leni, the Elephanta Caves that exist today are ruins of what were once elaborately painted artworks. It also provides an amazing view of the Mumbai skyline. You can reach the Elephanta Caves via a ferry ride from Gateway of India. This collection of cave temples dates back to 5th to 7th centuries and most of them are dedicated to Lord Shiva.

        There are two groups of alcoves in the site of the Elephanta Caves, the first is a large group of five Hindu caves and the second one is a smaller group of two Buddhist caves. The Hindu caves contain the stone sculptures representing the Shaiva Hindu sect. The caves are an expression of art and a number of important imageries are sculpted here, which include 'Trimurti' or three-headed Shiva, 'Gangadhar' which is a manifestation of the river Ganga as she descends to the earth and 'Ardhnareshwar', which is a representation of Shiva and Parvati in the same body. In addition to being an important heritage site, the Elephanta Caves are also an unlikely trekking destination.
        
        Winter months from November to February are the best time to visit the caves. Avoid peak monsoon season (June to August ) as the sea becomes unpredictable and ferry schedules get disrupted. Morning hours are better to visit this destination.`,

        The Sanjay Gandhi National Park, previously known as the Borivali National Park covers approximately 20% of Mumbai's geographical area and is home to a staggering thirteen hundred species of flora and more than five hundred species of fauna respectively. Covering an area of 104 square kilometers, it is one of Asia's most visited National Parks with over 2 million visitors every year. The park is also said to be the largest park in the world located within city limits. There are two artificial lakes within the forest thriving with crocodiles and migratory birds all year. The lakes supply drinking water to the city. The park was first introduced in 1974 and helps to have a change from the usual sights, attractions, and rush of the big city. The Sanjay Gandhi National Park is known for its evergreen dense forests, bird population, butterflies, and the small population of tigers.`,
